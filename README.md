# Detection-web-attack
Nowadays, cyber-attacks are an increasingly serious problem, so an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a significant guarantee of network security. The IDS is used to detect attacks and intrusions into the network system. But in today's new state of cybersecurity protection, this method cannot detect new types of attacks such as zero-days. Because the zero-day vulnerability is unknown, software vendors have not had time to develop and distribute patches to patch the vulnerability. This creates favorable conditions for attackers to take advantage of the vulnerability to carry out attacks without being detected or prevented.

One way to solve this problem is using AI in the IDS to detect anomalies in network traffic. But another problem comes from this solution. Many models in machine learning can be used, so what is the best  model that fits in detecting abnormal traffic?

# Dataset
Taken from CIC-IDS2017: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

# Experiment
Experiment 1: Detect and label abnormal or normal network traffic.
Experiment 2: Detect and label normal or XSS or SQL Injection or Brute-Force
